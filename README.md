# cse210-project

--What program are we going to create? Use your brainstorming from the solo checkpoint to answer this question together.

We are going to create the Chrome dino jumper game, but we are thinking we will change the main character to 
a kangaroo and give the background graphics some color. 


--What technologies will we use? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to remind yourselves of the language, libraries and anything else you plan on using.

We will be using Python as the language. Then we will use the Arcade and Random libraries. 


--What features will we include? The goal of asking this question is to identify what will and what won't be included. Use this simple feature planning guide to help you.

--What is your timeline? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to review the rest of the course schedule together.

Our timeline is to keep up with the course guidelines for each week and not get behind.
